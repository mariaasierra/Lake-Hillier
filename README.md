# Lake-Hillier

Lake Hillier is a hypersaline lake known for its distinctive bright pink color. The cause of this phenomenon in other hypersaline sites has been attributed to halophiles but there is no clear evidence of the microorganisms that might be contributing to its color.

Here we analyzed amplicon and whole genome sequence data and showed the presence of microbes from all domains: bacteria, archaea, eukaryota, and viruses.
